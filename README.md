## Installation ##

### With pip ###

You can install **Alfred-Workflow** directly into your workflow with:

```bash
pip install --target=/path/to/my/workflow Alfred-Workflow
```

**Note**: If you intend to distribute your workflow to other users, you should
include **Alfred-Workflow** (and other Python libraries your workflow requires)
within your workflow as described. Do not ask users to install anything into
their system Python.

###Â From source ###

1. Download the `alfred-workflow-X.X.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow/releases).
2. Either extract the ZIP archive and place the `workflow` directory in the root folder of your workflow (where `info.plist` is) **or**
3. Place the ZIP archive in the root folder of your workflow and add `sys.path.insert(0, 'alfred-workflow-X.X.zip')` at the top of your Python script(s).

Your workflow should look something like this:

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow/
            __init__.py
            background.py
            workflow.py
            web.py
        yourscript.py
        etc.

Or this:

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow-1.X.X.zip
        yourscript.py
        etc.

**Note:** the `background.py` module will not work from within a zip archive.

Alternatively, you can clone/download the Alfred-Workflow [repository](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow) and copy the `workflow` subdirectory to your workflow's root directory.

## Usage ##

A few examples of how to use **Alfred-Workflow**.

### Workflow script skeleton ###

Set up your workflow scripts as follows (if you wish to use the built-in error handling or `sys.path` modification):

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# encoding: utf-8

import sys

from workflow import Workflow


def main(wf):
    # The Workflow instance will be passed to the function
    # you call from `Workflow.run`
    # Your imports here if you want to catch import errors
    # or if the modules/packages are in a directory added via `Workflow(libraries=...)`
    import somemodule
    import anothermodule
    # Get args from Workflow, already in normalised Unicode
    args = wf.args

    # Do stuff here ...

    # Add an item to Alfred feedback
    wf.add_item(u'Item title', u'Item subtitle')

    # Send output to Alfred
    wf.send_feedback()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    wf = Workflow()
    sys.exit(wf.run(main))
```

### Examples ###

Cache data for 30 seconds:

```python
def get_web_data():
    return web.get('http://www.example.com').json()

def main(wf):
    # Save data from `get_web_data` for 30 seconds under
    # the key ``example``
    data = wf.cached_data('example', get_web_data, max_age=30)
    for datum in data:
        wf.add_item(datum['title'], datum['author'])
    wf.send_feedback()
```

#### Web ####

Grab data from a JSON web API:

```python
data = web.get('http://www.example.com/api/1/stuff').json()
```

Post a form:

```
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/', data={'artist': 'Tom Jones', 'song': "It's not unusual"})
```

Upload a file:

```
files = {'fieldname' : {'filename': "It's not unusual.mp3",
                        'content': open("It's not unusual.mp3", 'rb').read()}
}
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/upload/', files=files)
```

**WARNING**: As this module is based on Python 2's standard HTTP libraries, it *cannot* validate SSL certificates when making HTTPS connections. If your workflow uses sensitive passwords/API keys, you should *strongly consider* using the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library upon which the `web.py` API is based.

#### Keychain access ####

Save password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.save_password('name of account', 'password1lolz')
```

Retrieve password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.get_password('name of account')
```

## Contributing ##

Bug reports, feature suggestions and pull requests are very welcome. Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow/issues) if you have a feature request or a bug report.

If you want to make a pull request, do that [here](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow/pulls), but please bear the following in mind:

- **Alfred-Workflow** has very close to 100% test coverage. The only code that isn't covered by unit/functional tests is the code that opens external applications. "Proof-of-concept" pull requests without tests are more than welcome. However, please be prepared to add the appropriate tests if you want your pull request to be ultimately accepted.
- Complete coverage is *only a proxy* for decent tests. Tests should also cover a decent variety of valid/invalid input. For example, if the code *could potentially* be handed non-ASCII input, it should be tested with non-ASCII input.
- Code should be [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)-compliant as far as is reasonable. Any decent code editor has a PEP8 plugin that will warn you of potential transgressions.
- Please choose your function, method and argument names carefully, with an eye to the existing names. Obviousness is more important than brevity.
- Document your code using the [Sphinx ReST format](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Even if your function/method isn't user-facing, some other developer will be looking at it. Even if it's only a one-liner, the developer may be looking at [the docs](http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/#api-docs) in a browser, not at the source code.
- Performance counts. Alfred will try to run a workflow anew on every keypress. As a rule, 0.3 seconds execution time is decent, 0.2 seconds or less is smooth. **Alfred-Workflow** should do its utmost to consume as little of that time as possible.

Currently, there is Travis-CI integration, but also a `run-tests.sh` script in the root directory of the repo which will fail *if code coverage is less than 100%* (Travis-CI also uses this script). Add `# pragma: no cover` with care.
